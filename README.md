When issues occur, end users will need to submit a ticket describing the issue so that the appropriate agents can work to resolve the issue as soon as possible. This is an example of what the initial creation if a ticket would look like. Depending on how well the ticket is described, agents may decide to reclassify and/or change the department that is required to resolve this problem.

After a ticket is created, agents will be able to log in and start the solution process. As seen above, John was able to log in and modify the ticket so that it can be handled appropriately. Based on the description, John changed the SLA Plan to "Sev-A" which which deems it a very severe problem. He then changed the Help Topic to "Business Critical Outage" and assigned it to the Online Banking team to continue the resolution process. These adjustments were necessary in order to have the correct agents working a ticket to ensure that it gets resolved as quickly and easily as possible.

With the ticket assigned to the Online Banking team, Jane was able to log in and continue resolving this issue. She first assigned the ticket to herself and made it clear to any other agents that she will be working on the fix primarily. She then added a reply addressing what she thought the root cause of the issue may be which give a clear indicator of the steps taken to fix the issue. Lastly, Jane determines that it was an update that caused the issue, rolls back the update and notifies any involved entities and confirms that the issue is now resolved and a permanent fix will be sought after. The detailed explanations are necessary and show not only a great understanding on what the issue my be but also a look into the process that would be required if said issue were to happen again.
